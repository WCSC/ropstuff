Some basic ROP stuff. For the last problem, https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget will be quite useful.

Compile it like so:

$ gcc -m32 rop1.c

But I did compile it for you anyways...

It's a super-simple buffer overflow - you're supposed to be learning ROP.

Have fun! 
Feel free to ask bspar (hackint IRC) or will@whitehatters.org for help. Or many other people on IRC. There's also #WCSChelp (on IRC) with lots of helpful people. And #WCSCbinary was made for this, so check there, too! Or do whatever you want.


rop1: simple ROP to shell()

rop2: requires slightly more creativity

rop3: basic ROP! You'll need some gadgets for this one

sploit3: rop3 solution - cheating makes me sad :(
